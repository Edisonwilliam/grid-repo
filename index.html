           I received a job offer mid-course,and the subjects 
           I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
           I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

         "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.I've been looking to make a
         transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
         the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
         weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.Since completing the course.I've
         successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp.I've never written a line of code
          .I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
          of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curiculum and staff did not disapoint.They were very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular,
          was outstanding it took my learning to the next level in a way
          that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,I've often referred to it during interviews
          as an example of my development experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!."
